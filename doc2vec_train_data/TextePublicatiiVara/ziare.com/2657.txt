Scoala de Arte din Glasgow, imobil istoric cunoscut si sub denumirea de cladirea Mackintosh, a fost distrusa de un incendiu, la patru ani dupa ce fusese afectata partial de foc.
Flacarile au izbuncinit vineri seara, la putin timp dupa ora 23:00, extinzandu-se la un club din apropiere, fara insa a se inregistra victime, anunta BBC.
La interventie au participat peste 120 de pompieri.
Cladirea, construita in 1909, dupa proiectul lui Charles Rennie Mackintosh, a mai fost grav afectata de foc in mai 2014 si urma sa fie reschisa anul viitor in urma unei ample restaurari care a costat mai multe milioane de lire sterline.
Atunci a fost distrusa biblioteca, cunoscuta ca unul dintre cele bune exemple de Art Nouveau din lume.
